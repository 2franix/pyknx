usage: pyknxconf.py [-h] [-i LKNCONF] [-o FILE] [-c COMMUNICATORADDRESS]
                    [-n COMMUNICATORNAME] [--clean] [-v LEVEL]

Modifies an XML config for Linknx so that it allows for communication with an
instance of pyknxcommunicator.py This script adds an ioport and a rule for
each object that holds a callback attribute in the source XML. It always
starts by cleaning any autogenerated rule from the input file and generates
new ones unless the --clean option is passed. Source XML configuration is read
from standard input unless the -i option is set.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i LKNCONF, --input-file LKNCONF
                        use LKNCONF as the source linknx configuration rather
                        than reading from standard input.
  -o FILE, --output-file FILE
                        write the modified linknx configuration to FILE rather
                        than to standard output.
  -c COMMUNICATORADDRESS, --comm-addr COMMUNICATORADDRESS
                        Address of the communicator. This argument must
                        specify the hostname or the ip address followed by a
                        colon and the port to listen on. Default is
                        "localhost:1029"
  -n COMMUNICATORNAME, --comm-name COMMUNICATORNAME
                        Name of the communicator. Used to build the name of
                        callback attributes on object definitions, to prefix
                        name of rules generated by this script and to name the
                        ioport service. Default is "pyknx" which leads to an
                        ioport "pyknx" and callback attributes
                        "pyknxcallback". This option is useful when several
                        communicators have to connect to the same linknx
                        instance without interfering with each other.
  --clean               Clean rules that were generated by this script but do
                        not generate new rules.
  -v LEVEL, --verbose LEVEL
                        set verbosity level. Default is "warning".
