                    ID [ID ...]

Lightweight command line client for linknx. It is aimed at reading object
values from linknx.

positional arguments:
  ID                    ID represents the identifier of the object to read.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s HOST, --server HOST
                        Hostname of the machine running the linknx daemon.
                        Default is localhost.
  -p PORT, --port PORT  Port linknx listens on. Default is 1028.
  -R, --regex           ID in the "object" argument is interpreted as a regex
                        and used to find objects to read. The pattern must
                        comply with the 're' python module.
  --value-only          Output the value of the queried object but do not
                        prefix it with the object's id.
  --expected-value EXPECTED_VALUE
                        Expected value of the object. This script will exit
                        with a non-zero return code if the value is not the
                        expected one. This is useful when using this script in
                        a "if" test of a shell script.
  -v LEVEL, --verbose LEVEL
                        Set verbosity level. Default is "error".
