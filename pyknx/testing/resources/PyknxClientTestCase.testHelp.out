                      ACTION ARG

Lightweight command line client for linknx. It is aimed at reading or writing
object values from/to linknx or to executing actions.

positional arguments:
  ACTION                Action to perform. ACTION can be one of {read, write,
                        execute}.
  ARG                   Action's argument, whose meaning depends on the action
                        type. When ACTION=read or ACTION=write, ARG represents
                        the identifier of the object to touch. If
                        ACTION=execute, this is the XML representation of the
                        action to execute (for instance <action type="set-
                        value" id="kitchen_heating" value="comfort"/>.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s HOST, --server HOST
                        Hostname of the machine running the linknx daemon.
                        Default is localhost.
  -p PORT, --port PORT  Port linknx listens on. Default is 1028.
  -R, --regex           When used in conjunction with ACTION=read, ARG is
                        interpreted as a regex and used to find objects to
                        read. The pattern must comply with the 're' python
                        module.
  --value-only          When used in conjunction with ACTION=read, outputs the
                        value of the queried object but do not prefix it with
                        the object's id.
  --expected-value EXPECTED_VALUE
                        When used in conjunction with ACTION=read, represents
                        the expected value of the object. This script will
                        exit with a non-zero return code if the value is not
                        the expected one. This is useful when using this
                        script in a "if" test of a shell script.
  -v LEVEL, --verbose LEVEL
                        set verbosity level. Default is "error".
