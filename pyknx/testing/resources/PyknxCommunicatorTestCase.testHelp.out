usage: pyknxcommunicator.py [-h] [-c COMMUNICATORADDRESS] [-l LINKNXADDRESS]
                            [--log-file FILE] [-v LEVEL]
                            FILE

Starts an instance of the Pyknx communicator daemon. The daemon is aimed at
listening for linknx events for object changes in order to call Python
functions that are implemented in a script that is passed to the daemon. This
process allows for execution of Python code in reaction of object changes on
linknx's end.

positional arguments:
  FILE                  use FILE as the user python script that implements
                        callbacks functions declared in the linknx
                        configuration (see the pyknxcallback attributes in
                        XML).

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c COMMUNICATORADDRESS, --comm-addr COMMUNICATORADDRESS
                        Address of the communicator. This argument must
                        specify the hostname or the ip address followed by a
                        colon and the port to listen on. Default is
                        "localhost:1029"
  -l LINKNXADDRESS, --linknx-addr LINKNXADDRESS
                        Address of the linknx server to bind to. This argument
                        must specify the hostname or the ip address followed
                        by a colon and the port. Default is "localhost:1028"
  --log-file FILE       write communicator's output to FILE rather than to
                        standard output.
  -v LEVEL, --verbose LEVEL
                        set verbosity level. Default is "error".
