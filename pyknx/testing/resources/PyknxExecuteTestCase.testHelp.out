usage: pyknxexecute.py [-h] [-s HOST] [-p PORT] [--action ACTION] [-v LEVEL]

Lightweight command line client for linknx. It is aimed at executing actions
defined by a XML string. The action to execute is read from standard input
unless the --action option is set. Example of a valid action: <action
type="set-value" id="kitchen_heating" value="comfort"/>. This string is passed
as-is to linknx so refer to linknx's documentation for further details.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s HOST, --server HOST
                        Hostname of the machine running the linknx daemon.
                        Default is localhost.
  -p PORT, --port PORT  Port linknx listens on. Default is 1028.
  --action ACTION       use the ACTION string as the XML representation of the
                        action to execute rather than reading it from standard
                        input.
  -v LEVEL, --verbose LEVEL
                        Set verbosity level. Default is "error".
